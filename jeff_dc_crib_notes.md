# 00 Before we get started
1. Working Directory
2. RStudio to manage WD
    - Open RStudio
    - Create Project data-carpentry
    - Create data/ and download data into it
    - Create data-carpentry-script.R
    - Show diagram
3. RStudio walk-through
    - Panes
    - Auto-complete
    - R Code
        - Code is instructions to computer: 2-ways
        - Console
            - prompt (> vs +)
            - ESC
        - Script to console (buttons and ctrl-enter)
4.  Basics of R
    - Free and Open Source
    - Better than commercial
        - First implementations
        - widely extensible (nrow(available.packages()))
    - 1000's of developers vs 10's-100's
    - huge and (mostly) friendly community
    - functional and OO
    - not just for stats, general purpose programming too.
5. R Syntax
    - http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html#the-r-syntax
    - comments
    - assignment operator
    - a function
    - = for args
    - $
    - quotes v not quotes
6. Using functions

    - args(round)
    - show multiple args

7. The most important skill in coding: HELP!
    - https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/716390583217029124
    - When you know the function
        - ? or help
        - args
        - RStudio auto-complete
    - When you know the package
        - help(package="dplyr")
    - When you know a bit of the topic
        - ??smirnov
        - ??histogram
    - Google and Stackoverflow
        - Asking good questions (see http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html#asking-for-help)
