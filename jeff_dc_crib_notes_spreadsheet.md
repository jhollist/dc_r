http://jwhollister.com/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/

1. Intro myself and helpers
2. Plea for flexibility 
3. Code of conduct and other stuff on workshop site
4. Twitter stuff 
5. Get Data
5. Check on spreadsheet installs

# 00 Spreadsheet Intro
http://jwhollister.com/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/00-intro.html

1. Our goals are:
    - Good data entry practices - formatting data tables in spreadsheets
    - How to avoid common formatting mistakes
    - Dates as data - beware!
    - Basic quality control and data manipulation in spreadsheets

    - In short, good data organization and managment foundation of research
2. We won't be showing:
    - How to do statistics in a spreadsheet
    - How to do plotting in a spreadsheet
    - How to write code in spreadsheet programs
3. Our main focus is to focus on automation and reproducibility, these are very hard with GUI driven tools
4. Given this, why focus on spreasheets:
    - Some questions re: Spreadsheets
        - Who uses spreadsheets?
        - What type of tasks do you use them for?
        - Is it easy to automate tasks?
        - Ever had any problems?
    - Spreadsheets are ubiquitous and useful. 
    - Learn about some best pracices to our use of spreadsheets that will help out in the long run

# 01 Formatting Data Tables
http://jwhollister.com/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/01-format-data.html

1. Learn some best practices for structuring a dataset and for things to do when cleaning up a dataset.
2. Think about a spreadsheet like a computer would not like a human.
    - Notes, Colors, Merged Cells, empty columns or rows are great for humans to read but data analysis is now done by computers!
    - Neat, tidy, orderly, rows, columns are all good things
    - Be nice to yourself and keep structure clean; The you in 6 months when you actually have time to analyze the data will be grateful!
3. Tidy Data Structure
    - Rows are observations (e.g. a sinlge sample, a patient, a plot)
    - Columns are Variables 
    - Values go in cells
    - Patient, date, hgt, weight, pulse, BP (prob)
    - Single data type in a column (don't mix text, numbers, dates,etc.)
    - leave raw data raw (edit data in a new file or new tab)
    - DOCUMENT EVERYTHING!
