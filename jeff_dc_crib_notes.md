# 00 Before we get started
1. Working Directory
2. RStudio to manage WD
    - Open RStudio
    - Create Project data-carpentry
    - Create data/ and download data into it
    - Create data-carpentry-script.R
    - Show diagram
3. RStudio walk-through
    - Panes
    - Auto-complete
    - R Code
        - Code is instructions to computer: 2-ways
        - Console
            - prompt (> vs +)
            - ESC
        - Script to console (buttons and ctrl-enter)
4.  Basics of R
    - Free and Open Source
    - Better than commercial
        - First implementations
        - widely extensible (nrow(available.packages()))
    - 1000's of developers vs 10's-100's
    - huge and (mostly) friendly community
    - functional and OO
    - not just for stats, general purpose programming too.
5. R Syntax
    - http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html#the-r-syntax
    - comments
    - assignment operator
    - a function
    - = for args
    - $
    - quotes v not quotes
6. Using functions
    - round
    - args(round)
    - show multiple args
        - named (orderd, not ordered)
        - not-named
7. The most important skill in coding: HELP!
    - https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/716390583217029124
    - When you know the function
        - ? or help
        - args
        - RStudio auto-complete
    - When you know the package
        - help(package="dplyr")
    - When you know a bit of the topic
        - ??smirnov
        - ??histogram
    - Google and Stackoverflow
        - Asking good questions (see http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html#asking-for-help)
    - Mailing Lists
    - Task Views
    
## 01 Intro to R
1. Creating Objects
    - Basic operators +, -, *, / 
    - can save result to an object with <- 
    - weight_kg <- 55
    - (weight_kg <- 55)
    - weight_kg <- 55; weight_kg
    - overwrite value
    - use math to change (*2.2 for lbs)
    - weight_lbs <- 2.2 * weight_kg
2. Challenge
    - work with person next to you
    - discuss what you think values would be
    - confirm using R
    - About 5 minutes
3. Vectors and data types
    - Vector
        - most basic structure
        - have length
        - have type (must be the same)
    - weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
    - weight_g
    - animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
    - animals
    - length(), class(), str()
    - add to the vector (beginning and end)
        - c(animals,"")
    - types
        - numeric
        - character
        - logical/boolean
        - integer
        - raw
        - complex
    - Other data structures
        - list
        - matrix
        - factor
        - data.frame
4. Challenge
    - Work on together
    - Weâ€™ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric, integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?
        - coercion
    - What class will these be?
    - num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, 'a')
    - num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
    - char_logical <- c('a', 'b', 'c', TRUE)
    - tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, '4')
    - c(3,"z",TRUE)
    - so: 
      - Logical > Numeric
      - Logical > Character
      - Character > Numeric
      - Character > Numeric + Logical
5. Subsetting
    - animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
    - animals[2]
    - animals[c(3,2)]
    - animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
    - animals[-3]
6. Conditional subsetting
    - weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
    - Subset based on logical
        - weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
    - so we can use conditional statements such as
        - weight_g > 50 
        - weight_g[weight_g > 50]
        - or: weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50]
        - and: weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
    - Works with both numeric and character
        - animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"]
        - %in%: animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck")
        - animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck")]
7. Challenge:
    - what does "four" > "five" return?
    - why?
8. Missing Data
    - Should have already discussed during spreadsheet, if not say a few words 
    - R's values is NA
    - for example: 
        - planets <- c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune", NA)
        - heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
        - mean(heights)
        - max(heights)
        - mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
        - max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
    - is.na()
    - na.omit()
    - complete.cases()
9. Challenge
    - Try this: sample <- c(2, 4, 4, "NA", 6); mean(sample, na.rm = TRUE)
    - What happens and why?
    - Why does the error message say the argument is not numeric?
